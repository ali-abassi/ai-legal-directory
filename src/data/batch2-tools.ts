The AI features now automate this process, generating Prezi presentations from text prompts with the platform's distinctive non-linear format.\n\nThe AI assistant helps create presentations, redesign existing decks, and generate talking points. Prezi Video lets you overlay your presentation content on top of your video feed during virtual meetings, which is a genuine differentiator for remote presentations.\n\nPrezi is best for presenters who want to stand out from the endless stream of linear slide decks. The zooming format works well for topics with hierarchical or spatial relationships. However, the non-linear format is not for everyone — some audiences find it disorienting, and the learning curve is steeper than traditional slide tools.",

It generates clean, modern code using popular frameworks and can make changes to running applications through conversational prompts.\n\nEmergent is part of the growing 'vibe coding' movement where AI handles implementation while humans focus on product decisions. It works well for MVPs, internal tools, and standard web applications. Complex or highly custom applications may exceed what the AI can generate reliably, requiring developer intervention to extend.",

Each agent is pre-configured for its domain and can execute tasks autonomously.\n\nThe platform is designed for small businesses and solopreneurs who need to scale operations without hiring. You assign tasks to the relevant AI employee, and it executes using built-in knowledge and integrations. The agents can post to social media, respond to emails, generate reports, and manage routine workflows.\n\nSintra sits between general AI assistants and full automation platforms. The 'employee' metaphor makes it more approachable than workflow builders for non-technical users.
