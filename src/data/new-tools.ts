You can extend backgrounds, remove objects, and composite scenes in ways that previously required hours of manual work.\n\nThe standalone web app at firefly.adobe.com is free to try, but the real value comes from the Creative Cloud integration. If you already pay for Adobe, Firefly is included. The output quality is solid though not always as artistic as Midjourney — it excels at clean, commercial-ready imagery rather than stylized art.",
