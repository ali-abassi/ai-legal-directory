You create 'Zaps' — automated workflows triggered by events in one app that perform actions in others. The AI features include natural language workflow creation, AI-powered data formatting, and built-in ChatGPT steps.\n\nThe platform handles everything from simple two-app automations (new email → Slack notification) to complex multi-step workflows with conditional logic, filters, and data transformation. The AI assistant can build Zaps from a plain English description of what you want automated.\n\nZapier's strength is breadth — nearly every SaaS tool has a Zapier integration. The free tier includes 100 tasks per month across 5 Zaps, which is enough to automate a few key workflows. Power users and teams will need paid plans as task volumes grow. The reliability is excellent for a no-code tool.",
