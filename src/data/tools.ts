It handles CRUD operations, user authentication, role-based access, and workflow logic well. The limitation is that truly complex applications with custom business logic may push beyond what no-code can handle gracefully.",

Independent studies have shown its accuracy matches or exceeds average human reviewers for standard contract types. It is not designed for complex, novel, or highly negotiated agreements — those still need human lawyers.

    description: "Open-source framework for building and deploying AI agents with tool use, memory, and API endpoints.",
    longDescription: "Superagent is an open-source platform for building, managing, and deploying AI agents. It provides a framework where you define agents with specific tools, knowledge bases, and memory, then deploy them as API endpoints that can be integrated into any application.\n\nThe platform supports multiple LLM providers and includes built-in integrations for vector databases, web browsing, code execution, and document processing. The visual workflow builder lets you chain agents together, and the API-first design makes it straightforward to embed agents into existing products.\n\nSuperagent targets developers building AI-powered features into their applications. The open-source version is self-hostable with no feature restrictions, and the cloud version adds managed hosting and monitoring. For teams that want custom AI agents with specific tools and knowledge rather than general-purpose chatbots, Superagent provides a solid foundation.",
