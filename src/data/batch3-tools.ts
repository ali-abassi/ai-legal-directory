    longDescription: "Poe is Quora's AI chat platform that provides access to multiple language models — including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral — through a single interface. Instead of subscribing to multiple AI services, you can compare and use different models from one place.\n\nThe platform also includes user-created bots — custom AI characters and assistants built on top of the available models with specific system prompts and knowledge. You can create your own bots and share them with the community, and popular bots cover everything from coding help to creative writing to language learning.\n\nPoe's free tier provides limited access to premium models and unlimited access to smaller models. The $20/mo subscription significantly increases the quotas for GPT-4 and Claude. For users who want to experiment with multiple AI models or find the best one for specific tasks, Poe removes the friction of managing separate accounts and subscriptions.",

    longDescription: "HuggingChat is Hugging Face's free, open-source alternative to ChatGPT. It runs on top of leading open-source models like Llama, Mistral, and Command R, giving users access to powerful AI chat without needing a paid subscription. The interface is clean and supports features like web search, document upload, and custom assistants.\n\nBeing open-source, HuggingChat is transparent about which model is running and how it works. You can switch between different open-source models to compare their capabilities. The custom assistant feature lets you create specialized chatbots with specific system prompts and share them publicly.\n\nHuggingChat is ideal for users who prefer open-source AI or want to try different models without cost. The quality of responses depends on the underlying model — the best open-source models are now competitive with proprietary alternatives for many tasks. The platform does not store conversations by default, which is a privacy advantage. The main limitation is that it lacks some advanced features of paid platforms like image generation and advanced tool use.",
